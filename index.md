### Current Project

As a PhD student, I'm currently working on 3D Genomics in breast cancer cells.

### CTCF binding in breast cancer cells

CTCF is an 11 zinc-finger protein highly-prevalent in Topologically Associating Domains (TAD) boundaries. CTCF binding sites are most of the time convergently oriented, allowing for its coordination with the Cohesin protein complex during loop extrusion and TAD formation. Thus, it is essential to precisely identify CTCF binding sites in our breast cancer model.  

### 3D Genomics: Hi-C with CNV identification 

Hi-C allows for the identification of chromatin interaction in our breast cancer model.

Cancer Hi-C maps allow for the identification of Copy Number Variations and how they impact gene regulation and expression.

### Editing the TopDom TAD calling algorithm

I edited the TopDom TAD calling algorithm to overcome a minor overflow bug: [here](https://github.com/JSegueni/TopDom).
